# pyWebWatch

By: Dan Goodman

*A legendary one night project (hopefully, I'll probably keep adding features when I get bored)*

## WHAT I DIDN'T DO YET AND MAY NOT

- Schedule the pyWebWatch.py file to run in the background on a set interval, if you want to use this then you probably are capable of setting this up to run on an interval (cron)

## Supported Operating Systems

- macOS
- Linux

*If you are going to complain about adding windows why don't you add the config and background service handling in and make a PR?*

## What is this?

**pyWebWatch** is a tool for monitoring webpages for changes on a set interval. I has a menu, stored configs, runs as a background service, and can notify you in the listed methods below

## But why?

I thought of this on the walk home from dinner and was wondering if I could make an open source webpage watcher in a single night. Now if you will excuse me I got to get coding it instead of writing a readme file!
